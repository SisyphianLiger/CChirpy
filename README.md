# What is this project?

This project is taking all of the principles from Boot.devs Golang Backend Module and implementing them in an OOP language, i.e. C#. The goal is to better understand the nuances and differences between the two methods as well as explore the trade-offs to each one. 

# Why C#?

C# is a widely popular language here in Denmark, and after learning a lot about how servers work on boot.dev, I want to further improve my understanding of them by writing servers in different paradigms. 

# What to look for?

I will be making short journals after every chapter highlighting key differences between Golang and C# and using some of the code from both projects to compare and contrast. Those that read this file should be able to better understand some of the design decisions I have made. Furthermore, whether you are a C# dev wanting to learn Golang or vice versa, my hope is that by reading my Journal you can better understand both languages. 

# Where I am coming from?

I have had lots of Java at university here in Denmark, but much less C#, and I wanted to really dive into C# and see why it is so widely used for myself. So this is my journey into the deep of making a functional backend in C#! I hope you enjoy reading!

# Where do I read the Journals?

I will be creating a Journal Folder filled with Chapters based on the Boot Dev Module, 9 in total.
